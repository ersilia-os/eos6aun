    "Description": "RXNFP uses a pre-trained BERT Language Model to transform a reaction represented as smiles into a fingerprint amenable for downstream applications. The authors show how the RXN-fps can be used to identify nearest neighbors on reaction datasets, or map the reaction space without knowing the reaction centers.",
